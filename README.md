# CryptoFest - seminář

## Tento seminář je letos zaměřen na ty, co mají zájem o bezpečnost.

## Proběhne v sobotu 26. 5. od 10:00 v posluchárně 107 na [FIT CVUT](https://www.fit.cvut.cz) společne s [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18)

### Program


* 10:00 - 10:50 - Ondřej Caletka - **Jak šifrovat disk**

* 11:00 - 11:45 Petr Krčmář - **Role certifikátu při zabezpečení šifrovaného spojení**

 Šifrování se stává stále běžnějším a dostupnějším, většina navštěvovaných webů dnes má HTTPS. Neodmyslitelnou součástí dobře navrženého šifrování je také autentizace. V případě TLS se o ni starají certifikáty. Co to přesně certifikát je, jaká je jeho role a co všechno v něm najdeme?


* 13:00 - 13:45 - Vítězslav Čížek - **Introduction to TLS 1.3**

 TLS 1.3 is the brand new version of the SSL/TLS protocol. 
The draft of the standard was recently approved by IETF and it will be published as RFC in a couple of months.

 TLS 1.3 is a big redesign of the protocol which brings substantial changes such as better security or handshake speed-up.

 The talk will present its new features as well as compare the new protocol to the previous versions. 
It will also focus on the status of openSUSE, for example how are the web browsers, common cryptography libraries, and applications doing with regard to the TLS 1.3 support.


 

* 14:00 - 14:45 - David Bečvařík - **Let's talk about containers and security**

 Containers are becoming more and more popular way how we develop and deploy applications. We trust them to protect our applications, but do we understand how they security model works? How they're isolated and sand-boxed? Let's look at all the pieces in Linux which are there to isolate and support containers security. We will then continue with overview what every deployment pipeline should perform to maintain secure and  not vulnerable container images. At the end we will speak about common mistakes we do and which really lowers protection of ours containerized applications. 


* 15:00 - 15:45 - Hans de Raad  - **The new EU CyberSecurity Act**

 Fibre to the home opens numerous interesting possibilities for both bona-fide and not so bona-fide use cases. 
Having your espresso machine or refrigerator being part of a multi-million device botnet which is attacking critical infrastructure might not necessarily be your first association when zipping your early morning caffeine fix. 
Not only might this notion be somewhat disruptive for your early morning zen-moment, you might also be held legally accountable for these actions as it is actually your home network participating in an international attack wreaking havoc on, let’s say, the healthcare information system of a close NATO ally. 
Nowadays there is zero quality control being enforced over internet connected devices in general. But the EU (and US) have decided this somewhat naive approach should come to an end.

 A new directive (NIS, Directive on the Security of Network and Information Systems) comes into effect. Especially for branches active in the development of internet connected devices with a direct application in the “quality of life improvement” domain, this will be something to look out for: 
 Medical devices 
 Automotive 
 Domotica

 This new directive includes the ambition of implementing a certification scheme for IT systems and devices, this scheme will be based on the existing ISO 15408 standard:

 “ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009 establishes the general concepts and principles of IT security evaluation and specifies the general model of evaluation given by various parts of ISO/IEC 15408 which in its entirety is meant to be used as the basis for evaluation of security properties of IT products.”

 What does this standard encompass? What does open-source and free software have to do with this? Let’s have a closer look in this talk!


* 16:00 - 16:30 Karel Kočí - **Bezpečné doručení distribučních balíčků**


* 16:30 - 17:10 - Lightning talks (add in repo :)
